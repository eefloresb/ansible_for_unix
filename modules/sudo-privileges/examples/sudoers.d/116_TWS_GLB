## NA notes:  This is a standardization update to:NA 153_TWS_GLB_unapproved.  
## The filename has been changed, we recommend you convert your filename
##    and #include now.  Your  team may continue to use the old 
##    name; however, automation that will be deployed in 1Q 2015 may
##    force a move to the new global name.
##    REMINDER:  When you change the template name, be certain to change
##       in the #include statement, and remove the old file.
